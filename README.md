# Timetable-generator-Using-genetic-algorithm-in-python
The implementation of the genetic algorithm is done in Python. The code utilizes the random module for random selection and mutation operations. It also uses the pandas library to create a timetable Data Frame and export it to an Excel file.
The code defines various data structures such as lists and dictionaries to store information about subjects, teachers, classrooms, classroom capacities, lab hours, lunch hours, and office hours. It also includes functions for creating the initial population, calculating fitness scores, printing the timetable, and running the genetic algorithm.
Objectives :-Develop a timetable generation system using a genetic algorithm approach to automate the process of creating timetables for educational institutions, considering various constraints and requirements.
2. Optimize the timetable generation process by minimizing conflicts and maximizing resource utilization, resulting in efficient scheduling and improved academic experiences for students and teachers
